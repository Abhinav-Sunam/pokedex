# 🎮 My First Fetch API Project: Pokédex

This is a personal project I built while learning how to work with **External APIs** and **Asynchronous JavaScript**. As a Pokémon fan, I wanted to create something functional and fun that practice fetching real-time data and displaying it in a clean, retro-style interface.

## 🧠 What I Learned
* **Fetch API**: How to use `fetch()` to request data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and handle the JSON response.
* **Async/Await**: Using modern JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations so the app stays smooth while loading data.
* **Responsive CSS**: Building a "GameBoy" style container that works on both my MacBook and my iPhone without horizontal scrolling.
* **Version Control & Deployment**: Managing the project through the terminal on my Mac and deploying via Vercel for automatic updates.

## 🛠️ How I Built It
* **Vanilla JavaScript**: Focused on pure JS logic for DOM manipulation and API calls.
* **CSS3**: Hand-coded the layout using Flexbox and added pixel-art rendering for that classic look.
* **Git**: Used the command line to push updates and manage the repository.
